             I am a analytics engineer currently working for Walmart, and love spending time
             playing around with databases, building pipelines, managing devops workflows, and
             making poorly designed web apps. Below you can find a few fun projects I have done,
             and some base documentation outlining them. I love to talk about technology, so 
             feel free to reach out by sending me an email, or connecting over LinkedIn.
