                            In my free time I spend alot of time playing around with databases, 
                            building pipelines, managing devops workflows, and making poorly designed 
                            web apps. Below you can find a few fun projects I have done, and some base 
                            documentation outlining them. I love to talk about technology, 
                            so feel free to reach out by sending me an email, or connecting 
                            over LinkedIn.`
