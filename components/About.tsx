                Hi! I am a technologist who loves to tinker, learn new things, and is not afraid to break a couple things in the process. My
                experience mostly lies in Data Analytics and Engineering. I have spent several years solving complex problems, optimizing/automating processes,
                and building intuitive analytics solutions that tell a cohesive story, all at the highest enterpise scale.
