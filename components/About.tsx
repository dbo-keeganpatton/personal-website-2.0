                                In my free time I spend a lot of time playing around with databases, 
                                building pipelines, managing devops workflows, and making poorly designed 
                                web apps. Below you can find a few fun projects I have done, and some base 
                                documentation outlining them. I love to talk about technology, 
                                so feel free to reach out by sending me an email, or connecting 
                                over LinkedIn.`
